        <h2>The Mandela Effect</h2>
        <p>Some people claim to remember TV coverage of Nelson Mandela’s death in the 1980s even though he actually died in 2013. 
            The “Mandela Effect” is therefore supposedly proof that whoever is in charge of our simulation is changing the past. 
            (Or alternately, this is evidence of parallel universes and some individuals have crossed from one universe, 
            in which Mandela died in the ’80s, into ours, where he lived to age 95.) 
            Additional examples of this phenomenon include some remembering the name of the Berenstain Bears children’s-book series
             being spelled as “Berentstein” and others recalling a nonexistent movie from the 1990s called Shazaam, 
             starring the comedian Sinbad as a genie.</p>

        <h2>Aliens</h2>
        <p>We’ve spent billions sending probes through outer space and should probably have found evidence of extraterrestrials by now, right? Not so fast: Aliens would likely be far more technologically advanced than we are, the thinking goes, so the fact that we haven’t located them suggests we live in a simulation they’ve figured out how to escape from. 
        Or maybe the computer we’re in only has enough RAM to simulate one planetary civilization at a time.</p>

        <h2>Why Does Our Universe Have “Rules” in the First Place?</h2>
        <p>MIT cosmologist Max Tegmark has pointed to our universe’s strict laws of physics as possible evidence that we live in a video game: “If I were a character in a computer game, I would also discover eventually that the rules seemed completely rigid and mathematical.” In this theory, the speed of light — the fastest rate at which any particle can travel
             — represents the speed limit for transmitting information within the network of our simulation.</p>
